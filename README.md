## First of all thank you so much for being a part of this legendary event! The art is up, the doors are about to be open, and we are about to go live!

There have been a few questions about getting into VRChat, and how to set up the mics /  audio, so I would like to go over all of that here. Please read over these instructions and reach out to me if you have any questions!

* Our Production Discord Channel https://discord.gg/DawvUYAj
* #consensus-artists-private


## Sound /  Hardware Check
We will meet up 30 mins or so before the event to do a sound check in the Discord Channel #consensus-artist-voice, to give time for guests to adjust their hardware.
Please consider getting there a little early to avoid any issues with your hardware.

## How to get into the VR Talks
![](https://i.imgur.com/yUGpDLC.png)

The studio is inside a video game called VRChat.

You can enter with a PC (with or without VR)

VRChat is a game you can download for free on Steam, or from [http://VRChat.com](http://VRChat.com)

Create an account on their website if you want a custom username as the Steam version will use your steam username adding a few weird numbers at the end of your name. Steam is easier, but it will automatically generate you a username based on your steam name. Use the website for a clean username.

## Adding Boomboxhead and Getting Into the Studio
Once you have your account, and you are ingame, look inside the main menu.

There is a "Social" button.

Search, and add "Boomboxhead" as a friend, and I will accept your friend request.

Now when I am online, you will see me online.
You can join the rooms I am in, and I can invite you to rooms.
We can send requests or invites into the production studio now that we are friends.

*Sorry about this onboarding friction, and it should get better in the future.*

## Avatars
If you dont have a custom avatar for the shoot that is fine! There are default avatars you can choose in the "Avatars" menu, and we will have a few to pick from in the room.

## Hardware Compatibility

* PC (Mac not supported)
* Oculus Rift
* HTC Vive
* Valve Index
* Oculus Quest
The VR world is Quest Compatible, but I recommend using the Oculus Link cable if you can, as the Quest battery life is low.

## Audio

Please check your **Audio input settings** prior before launching any software so that your **microphone works** during the show.


Test it in VRChat in the menu, you can see an audio meter if it is working.

If you are planning on using a Voice Mod, or something like that, please test before joining.

In game, you can change your audio input source, but make sure you have configured your windows audio prior to launching VRChat.

### How audio will work during recording and production:

We all will meet in Discord Channel #consensus-artist-voice in $Whale Discord to coordinate the production, and we will run our audio there. Please add DeCryptolorian(DC)#2849 on discord, to get the role to access the private channel.

Inside VRChat we turn down the ingame Voices Volume, in the settings, but keep our Mics ON so that the avatar mouths will move in game when we talk, but our audio will be recorded from the Discord Audio channel, not from the VRChat ingame audio.

**Please be mindful of your mic during recordings and live streams.**

So a recap, you will be inside VRChat, with the Voices muted in game. Our discord Voice channel will be the production audio going to stream, and to tape. Try to test your mic before the event or get the best mic you have available to sound the best!

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to use headphones so that there is no audio feedback.

## Voice/Video Calls
If you can not make it into VRChat: We can have you join us via webcam, using the production discord channel and our production audio. We encourage you to join on PC if you can't make VR, but we can get you in there via webcam as well.

If you have any questions please reach out to me boomboxhead#5796 or ask in the Discord Production Channel, and we can troubleshoot your hardware!

If we test our gear before the show, we will be in great shape for the live event! Please add me on discord in case of any issues, last minute changes or help with anything.

## Where will the livestreams be broadcasted?

 Day 1: http://twitch.tv/boomboxheads + studio recording
 Day 2: Streamed into Consensus 2021 Virtual Event + studio recording
 Day 3: Streamed into Consensus 2021 Virtual Event + studio recording

## Lights, Camera, Action!
